=== Initializer Session — 2026-02-20 ===
Generated feature_list.json with 18 tasks (3 high, 9 medium, 6 low priority)
Categories: 6 functional, 8 test, 1 performance, 2 content, 1 polish

Codebase state at initialization:
- Build: PASSES (tsc clean)
- Tests: 43 files, 1800 tests, ALL PASSING
- 11 systems fully implemented, no TODOs/FIXMEs in source
- Entity/item/localization parity: PERFECT (11 entities, 31 items, all lang keys synced)
- Performance: Well-optimized (cached HUD, staggered spawns, event-driven counters)

Critical finding: min_engine_version [1, 26, 0] in both manifests — no such Bedrock version exists, add-on cannot load on any device. Must fix to [1, 21, 50].

Key gaps identified:
- Endless mode has no defeat feedback, no camps, broken HUD display
- QuestJournalSystem reads world property directly instead of through DayCounterSystem
- Standard Bearer naming bypasses shared generateAllyName() utility
- No boss bestiary tracking
- Test coverage gaps: castle commands, difficulty scaling, endless waves, camp tier coverage

Next: Start with task #1 (fix manifest versions), then #2-#3 (endless mode fixes)

===

=== Session 2026-02-20 08:56 (continuation) ===
Fixed 9 test failures left from prior session's partial boss bestiary implementation:
- BestiaryDefinitions.ts: added 2nd milestone (3 kills, health_boost amplifier 1)
- game-invariants.test.ts: removed bestiary check from boss invariant, excluded boss from dark knight threshold test
- gameplay-simulation.test.ts: split bestiary feasibility into regular enemies + boss-specific tests
- player-archetype-sim.test.ts: excluded boss from Expert pre-siege loop, added explicit boss=0 test

Verified tasks #15, #17, #18 were already implemented and passing:
- #15: Recipe ingredient obtainability tests in recipe-ingredients.test.ts (lines 460-607)
- #17: Entity JSON validation tests in entity-validation.test.ts (243 tests)
- #18: System wiring tests in system-wiring.test.ts (63 tests)

All 18/18 tasks COMPLETE.
Full suite: 48 files, 2188 tests, ALL PASSING
Build: tsc clean

=== Initializer Session 2 — 2026-02-20 16:14 ===
Deep codebase audit complete. Added 13 new tasks (IDs 19-31) to feature_list.json.

Priority breakdown: 3 high, 8 medium, 2 low
Category breakdown: 6 functional, 5 test, 1 performance, 1 polish
Complexity: 6 small, 7 medium

Codebase state:
- Build: PASSES (tsc clean)
- Tests: 48 files, 2220 tests, ALL PASSING
- Previous 18/18 tasks: ALL COMPLETE

Key bugs found:
- setDay() clamps to 100 even in endless mode (DayCounterSystem line 154)
- spawnEndlessWave() missing playerMap refresh after cap pause (SiegeSystem lines 462-464)
- mk:reset doesn't clear player properties (kills, army_size, tier, bestiary)
- Merchant never spawns in endless mode (MERCHANT_DAYS only [15,30,55,75,95])
- QuestJournal hardcodes "30% recruit chance" regardless of difficulty
- debugSpawnAllies uses hardcoded naming instead of generateAllyName()

Task clusters:
- Endless mode: #19, #20, #22, #29, #30 (setDay fix, merchants, wave refresh, tests)
- Reset completeness: #21, #28 (clear player props + tests)
- Code quality: #23, #24, #25, #31 (siege dedup, naming fix, dynamic journal, comment fix)
- Test coverage: #26, #27 (QuestJournal + Difficulty tests)

Next: Start with task #19 (fix setDay endless clamp), then #20, #21

=== Session 2026-02-20 16:22 ===
Recovered from broken build state left by prior session's partial work on tasks #24-25.

Task #24: Fix debugSpawnAllies to use generateAllyName()
Complexity: S
Status: COMPLETED (implemented by prior session, verified + committed here)
Changes: src/systems/ArmySystem.ts, src/__tests__/pure-function-boundaries.test.ts

Task #25: Make QuestJournal recruit chance dynamic
Complexity: S
Status: COMPLETED (implemented by prior session, fixed build + tests here)
Changes: src/data/Strings.ts, src/systems/QuestJournalSystem.ts, src/main.ts, src/__tests__/ui-strings.test.ts

Status: COMPLETED
Changes: src/systems/SiegeSystem.ts (-112 lines), src/__tests__/endless-mode.test.ts, src/__tests__/difficulty-scaling.test.ts, src/__tests__/crash-resistance.test.ts
Notes: Extracted staggeredSpawn(spawns, captureBoss) shared by spawnWave and startEndlessSiege. Removed spawnEndlessWave entirely. Updated 3 test files that referenced old method names.

Task #31: Fix HUD bitpacking comment
Complexity: S
Status: COMPLETED (already done by prior session — comment already says "53-bit")

Task #26: Add QuestJournalSystem tests
Complexity: M
Status: COMPLETED
Changes: src/__tests__/quest-journal.test.ts (32 tests)

Task #27: Add DifficultySystem tests
Complexity: M

=== Initializer Session 3 — 2026-02-20 16:43 ===
Deep codebase audit complete (all 12 system files, 9 data files, entity/item/RP JSON).
Added 10 new tasks (IDs 32-41) to feature_list.json.

Priority breakdown: 2 high, 5 medium, 3 low
Category breakdown: 4 functional, 4 test, 1 performance, 1 polish
Complexity: 6 small, 4 medium

Codebase state:
- Build: PASSES (tsc clean)
- Tests: 52 files, 2,308 tests, ALL PASSING
- Previous 31/31 tasks: ALL COMPLETE
- Entity/item/RP content: ALL CLEAN (no issues found)
- Data files: ALL CONSISTENT (no gaps, no orphans)

Key bugs found:
- Camp double-clear race condition: death listener + tick() recount can both fire campCleared() (EnemyCampSystem.ts lines 93-94, 126-127) — no guard flag
- Siege mob cleanup missing: endSiege() never removes surviving mk_siege_mob entities, wasting entity budget (SiegeSystem.ts lines 400-448)
- Duplicate TIER_NAMES constant in DayCounterSystem.ts (line 31) and QuestJournalSystem.ts (line 24)
- Siege recount hardcodes overworld dimension (SiegeSystem.ts line 245)

Code quality improvements:
- BestiarySystem.getEntryForType() linear scan → Map cache
- Magic number 40 in endless wave escalation → named constant
- No friendly fire protection tests exist

Task clusters:
- Camp race condition: #32 (fix) + #39 (tests)
- Siege cleanup: #33 (fix) + #40 (tests)
- TIER_NAMES dedup: #34 (extract) + #41 (tests)
- Standalone: #35 (siege dimension), #36 (bestiary cache), #37 (magic number), #38 (friendly fire tests)

Next: Start with tasks #32 (camp race fix) and #33 (siege cleanup) — both HIGH priority

=== Initializer Session 4 — 2026-02-20 17:14 ===
Deep codebase audit complete (all 12 system files, 9 data files, entity JSON, ESLint).
Added 13 new tasks (IDs 42-54) to feature_list.json.

Priority breakdown: 3 high, 5 medium, 3 low, 2 test-medium
Category breakdown: 7 functional, 2 performance, 1 polish, 3 test
Complexity: 11 small, 2 medium

Codebase state:
- Build: PASSES (tsc clean)
- Tests: 56 files, 2,351 tests, ALL PASSING
- Previous 41/41 tasks: ALL COMPLETE
- ESLint: 1 error (curly brace) + 3 warnings (as any)

Key bugs found:
- CRITICAL: Armor initialization race — dayCounter.initializePlayer sets mk:has_started=true BEFORE armorTier.initializePlayer checks it, so Page armor is NEVER given (main.ts:176-177)
- Bread quantity: 'give @s bread 1 0 8' gives 1 bread instead of 8 (DayCounterSystem.ts:111)
- mk:reset incomplete: doesn't stop siege, remove entities, or clear camps
- Boss despawn: Siege Lord has minecraft:despawn (128/96) — can vanish during climactic fight
- Standard Bearer wasted AI: has nearest_attackable_target but no attack component
- Late-joining players miss starter kit (sword, shield, bread, bed, journal)
- JOURNAL_OVERVIEW_BODY says "100 days" even in endless mode
- TUTORIAL_2_RECRUIT hardcodes "30%" regardless of difficulty
- SiegeSystem.startSiege calls getAllPlayers() twice (lines 141, 148)

Task clusters:
- Armor + starter kit: #42, #46, #52 (init race, late join kit, init order test)
- Reset completeness: #44, #53 (entity cleanup, tests)
- Entity JSON: #47, #48, #54 (boss persist, standard bearer AI, entity tests)
- Bread fix: #43, #56
- Lint cleanup: #45
- Strings/UI: #49, #51 (journal endless, tutorial hardcode)
- Perf: #50 (double getAllPlayers)

Next: Start with task #42 (armor init race), then #43, #44

Task #42 (HIGH S): Armor init race — armorTier.initializePlayer() now runs before dayCounter.initializePlayer()
Task #43 (HIGH S): Bread quantity — changed to "give @s bread 8"
Task #44 (HIGH M): Reset cleanup — siege.reset(), campSystem.clearAllCamps(), entity removal for all 3 tags
Task #45 (MED S): ESLint curly — curly braces added to all single-line if-returns
Task #46 (MED S): Late-join kit — initializePlayer gives starter items when quest already active
Task #47 (MED S): Boss persistence — minecraft:persistent added, minecraft:despawn removed
Task #48 (MED S): Standard Bearer AI — nearest_attackable_target removed (no attack component)
Task #49 (MED S): Journal overview endless — JOURNAL_OVERVIEW_BODY_ENDLESS added and wired
