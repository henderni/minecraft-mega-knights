=== Initializer Session — 2026-02-20 ===
Generated feature_list.json with 18 tasks (3 high, 9 medium, 6 low priority)
Categories: 6 functional, 8 test, 1 performance, 2 content, 1 polish

Codebase state at initialization:
- Build: PASSES (tsc clean)
- Tests: 43 files, 1800 tests, ALL PASSING
- 11 systems fully implemented, no TODOs/FIXMEs in source
- Entity/item/localization parity: PERFECT (11 entities, 31 items, all lang keys synced)
- Performance: Well-optimized (cached HUD, staggered spawns, event-driven counters)

Critical finding: min_engine_version [1, 26, 0] in both manifests — no such Bedrock version exists, add-on cannot load on any device. Must fix to [1, 21, 50].

Key gaps identified:
- Endless mode has no defeat feedback, no camps, broken HUD display
- QuestJournalSystem reads world property directly instead of through DayCounterSystem
- Standard Bearer naming bypasses shared generateAllyName() utility
- No boss bestiary tracking
- Test coverage gaps: castle commands, difficulty scaling, endless waves, camp tier coverage

Next: Start with task #1 (fix manifest versions), then #2-#3 (endless mode fixes)

Verification: All passed (getCampTierForDay(150) returns Elite Outpost, day>=100 guard removed)

Task #4: Fix HUD display for endless mode
Status: COMPLETED
Changes: src/data/Strings.ts (HUD_ACTION_BAR_ENDLESS, DAY_CHANGE_ENDLESS), src/systems/DayCounterSystem.ts
